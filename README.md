## Encoding a message into a picture

### September 15th at 12:00 PM

I started a new fun project where I encode secret messages into images. I haven't gotten far yet, but I am making good progress. The hope is to take the message, and multiply it by a really big number, then encode that number into the picture as single pixels, which will be spaced pretty far apart. I'll update this on Saturday, maybe.

I made a lot of progress, now I have the encoder all set up, all I need to do is put the encoded pixels into the image of my choice, and I'll be good.
